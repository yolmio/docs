# Tutorial

Let's discover **Yolm in less than 5 minutes**.

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new Yolm app

Generate a new Yolm app using the **tutorial template**.

```bash
npm init @yolm/boost@latest
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Yolm.

Follow the prompts and select the **tutorial** template. It will take about 1-2 minutes to install all dependencies.

## Start your app

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-app
npm start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Yolm app, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm  start` command builds your app locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at


[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)



## Modify your app

Open `app.ts` and edit some display lines: the app **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

## Congratulations!

You built and modified your first Yolm app!
