Yolm takes a completely new and simple approach to full stack web applications.

You define your application typically in a single file in Typsecript: app.ts

In it you specify the database, the UI and their interactions.

You test your application locally with Yolm's development tools, which are as easy as `npm start`;

When you are ready you deploy your application with `npm run deploy`.

Next we'll look at how to define the database.
