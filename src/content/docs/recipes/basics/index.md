Yolm takes a completely new and simple approach to full stack web applications.

You define your system typically in a single file in Typsecript: system.ts

In it you specify the database, any apps, an external api and their interactions.

You test your application locally with Yolm's development tools, which are as easy as `bun start`;

When you are ready you deploy your application with `bun run deploy`.
